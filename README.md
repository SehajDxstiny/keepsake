# Keepsake (data for upcoming AGI) - Version 0.1

Welcome to the **Keepsake**, a simple yet powerful tool designed to help you document your life through daily journaling prompts. This app is built using a **Discord bot** that sends personalized questions at a set time each day, encouraging reflection and self-awareness. The goal is to build a comprehensive record of your thoughts, emotions, and experiences over time.

## Features

### Version 0.1
- **Daily Prompts**: The app sends a set of manually configured questions every day at a specific time via a Discord bot.
- **Structured Reflection**: Questions prompt you to reflect on your day, emotions, challenges, and highlights.
- **Habit Tracking**: Includes prompts related to daily habits such as meditation, exercise, and diet.
- **Day Rating**: Allows you to rate your day using a tier system (S, A, B, C, D).
- **Manual Question Management**: Questions are set manually for now but will be expanded with an API for dynamic question updates in future versions.

## Planned Features
As the app evolves, we plan to add more features to enhance the journaling experience:
- **Anki-like Spaced Repetition**: Certain questions will repeat at intervals (daily, weekly, monthly) to track changes in your thoughts and feelings.
- **AI Integration**: Future versions will include AI that analyzes your entries and provides insights or suggestions based on patterns in your journaling.
- **Media Integration**: Upload photos or voice notes alongside text entries to capture memories in more detail.
- **Life Map Visualization**: Create a visual map of your life with interconnected nodes representing key moments, emotions, and thoughts.

## How It Works

1. **Daily Prompts via Discord**: 
   - Every day at a specified time, the Discord bot sends you 3-5 questions. These questions can range from simple reflections on the day to deeper introspective prompts.
   - Example questions:
     - "What do you remember this day by?"
     - "How did you feel emotionally throughout the day?"
     - "Did anything stress you out today?"
   
2. **Habit Tracking & Day Scoring**:
   - You can track daily habits like meditation or exercise through simple checkboxes.
   - Rate your day with an S-tier to D-tier system based on how productive or fulfilling it was.

3. **Entry Storage & Retrieval**:
   - Your responses are stored in a database for future reference.
   - In future versions, you'll be able to view past entries and see how your answers evolve over time.
